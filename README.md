# 🌬️ ReneWind – Wind Turbine Failure Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

ReneWind is a **deep learning-based predictive maintenance system** designed to forecast wind turbine component failures before they occur.
By leveraging historical **sensor data from turbines** and applying **seven different neural network architectures**, this project aims to minimize operational downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and improve energy output efficiency.

---

## 🏢 Business Problem Statement

Wind turbines are critical in renewable energy production, but unexpected component failures can cause:

* **Significant downtime**
* **High repair costs**
* **Lost energy generation**

Our system predicts turbine failures in advance, enabling:

* **70–85% cost reduction** through proactive maintenance
* **Reduced downtime** and operational risk
* **Optimized maintenance schedules** for improved efficiency

---

## 📊 Dataset & Features

* **Training Samples:** 20,000
* **Testing Samples:** 5,000
* **Features:** 40 continuous **sensor variables** (V1–V40), representing mechanical and environmental conditions such as:

  * Temperature readings
  * Vibration metrics
  * Pressure levels
  * Wind speed and direction
  * Rotor & generator performance indicators

**Target Variable:** Binary classification – *Failure (1)* or *No Failure (0)*

---

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The project evaluates **7 deep learning models** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**, including:

* Dense feedforward networks with varying depth & width
* Dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
* Batch normalization for faster convergence
* Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

**Data Processing Pipeline:**

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Pandas, NumPy
2. **Feature Scaling** – Scikit-learn StandardScaler
3. **Train/Test Split** – Scikit-learn
4. **Model Training** – TensorFlow/Keras
5. **Evaluation** – Recall-focused performance metrics

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Since **false negatives** (missed failures) have a higher business cost, **Recall** is prioritized:

* **Primary Metric:** Recall
* **Secondary Metrics:** Precision, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
* **Business Outcome:** Higher recall → fewer undetected failures → reduced downtime costs
